(External Battery Pack – Servo Power)

Battery pack positive (+) → switch terminal 1

Switch terminal 2 → breadboard red (+) rail

Battery pack negative (–) → breadboard blue (–) rail

(ESP32 Ground Reference – VERY IMPORTANT)

Wire going from ESP32 GND → breadboard blue (–) rail

(This allows servo signals to work correctly)

(Servos – Power)

Servo OFF red wire → breadboard red (+) rail

Servo ON red wire → breadboard red (+) rail

(Servos – Signal to ESP32)

Servo OFF signal wire → ESP32 GPIO 18

Servo ON signal wire → ESP32 GPIO 19

(MOSFET – IRLZ44N Low-Side Switching)

Servo OFF ground wire → breadboard hole B15

Servo ON ground wire → breadboard hole C15

Wire going from breadboard hole D15 → MOSFET Drain (middle leg)

MOSFET Source (right leg) → breadboard blue (–) rail

(MOSFET Gate Control)

MOSFET Gate (left leg) → breadboard hole B20

Wire going from ESP32 GPIO 23 → breadboard hole B20

10k resistor leg → breadboard hole B20

Other leg of 10k resistor → breadboard blue (–) rail

(Pulldown resistor prevents random servo activation during boot)

(Servo Power Stabilization – Strongly Recommended)

Electrolytic capacitor positive (+) leg → breadboard red (+) rail

Electrolytic capacitor negative (–) leg → breadboard blue (–) rail

(470–1000 µF recommended for two servos)

⭐ Important physical placement notes

MOSFET legs must be in different rows

Keep Drain in the same row as both servo grounds

Do not place MOSFET across the breadboard center gap incorrectly

The MOSFET metal tab is connected to Drain — avoid touching ground

⭐ What should happen now

Battery switch ON → battery available but servos OFF

ESP32 command → GPIO23 HIGH → MOSFET connects ground

Servos move

Motion ends → MOSFET OFF → battery saved
